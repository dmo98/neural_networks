A few instructions on how to run the notebook:

1. Download the Cats vs Dogs dataset from: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765
2. Make sure the relative filepath to the cats images is 'DATA/PetImages/Cat/' and for the dog images is 'DATA/PetImages/Dog/'. There could be confusions if you downloaded the data from another source.
3. The image data will be saved into the 'features_rgb.npy' file; the labels will be saved into the 'labels_2.npy' file.

Run the notebook normally.
